# Inventory-Management

An inventory management system (or inventory system) is the process by which you track your goods throughout your entire supply chain, from purchasing to production to end sales. It governs how you approach inventory management for your business. 
We plan on updating this to implement Stock Advisory Services. The goods passing through will be the stock bought or sold by our customers and their management.

In a nutshell, this project idea aims to handle understocking and overstocking as both scenarios are unhealthy concerning businesses. In other words, Inventory Control Management has a huge role to play in retaining inventory at an optimum level.


Features needed â€“ You must keep a note of essential components such as rising inventory turnover, controlling safety stock levels, lowering insurance costs, etc. while designing this project.
